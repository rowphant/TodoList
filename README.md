# ToDo List App

A simple to-do-list app based on [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TailwindCSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) using local storage to store saved tasks.

## Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
